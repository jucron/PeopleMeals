## Setup via Docker

Requirement: Have Docker installed and make sure the
file [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) have only active the
profile #2 dev.

```docker
> First you need to create an image of PeopleMeals application. From files directory, type:
$ docker build -t peoplemeals .

> Start all containers in detach mode by executing the following command:
$ docker-compose up -d

```

**Note:** There will be exposed the following in localhost:

* `MySQL container: 3306`
* `PeopleMeals application: 8080`

## Usage

```html
> With a browser, access: http://localhost:8088/
(or your local url)
```

**Note:** It will be shared a dump of the database on mysql folder, on that dump you can create a dump of the database
if you want to, and it will be loaded when the DB is loaded.
