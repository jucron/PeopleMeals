http://localhost:8088/
```
**Note:** It will be shared a dump of the database on mysql folder, on that dump you can create a dump of the database if you want to, and it will be loaded when the DB is loaded.

## Database schema plan
Following relationships were implemented:
* Person - one to many - Planning
* Restaurant - one to many - Planning
* Planning - one to one - Dish
* Restaurant - many to many - Dish

## Architecture
It was organized a service-oriented architecture as can be seen below

`remove a Dish entity from repository`
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dishes/remove/{dishId}

`update a Dish entity from repository`
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dishes/update/{dishId} (DishDTO body)

* Person Entity

`add a Person entity to repository`
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/persons/add (PersonDTO body)

`remove a Person entity from repository`
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/persons/remove/{personId}

`update a Person entity from repository`
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/persons/update/{personId} (PersonDTO body) 

* Restaurant Entity
